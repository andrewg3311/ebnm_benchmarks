# Introduction
This code executes the functions in the `ebnm` package on simulated data. We simulate data according to different generating processes, and test the speed and accuracy of `ebnm_normal`, `ebnm_point_normal`, and `ebnm_point_laplace` functions.

```{r}
# Load required packages
library(workflowr)
library(microbenchmark)
devtools::load_all("../ebnm")
```

# `ebnm_normal` Testing
In this section, we test the `ebnm_normal` function.
